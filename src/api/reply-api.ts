On the other hand, Blazor is a technology similar to ASP.NET Core & ASP.NET MVC in that. It powers web applications It uses Razor as its template syntax for the creation of UI. A common point of misconception is that Blazor uses Razor. This further exacerbated by two other similar terms â€“ Blazor components and Razor components. Those are widely used interchangeably but the correct terminology is Razor Component. A component is the combination of markup (written in HTML) and logic (in C#) in a single Razor file (with the .cshtml extension).",
